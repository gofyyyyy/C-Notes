// Why Object-Oriented Programming?

// Before we discuss object-oriented programming, we need to learn why we need object-oriented programming?

//  1)   C++ language was designed with the main intention of adding object-oriented programming to C language
//  2)   As the size of the program increases readability, maintainability, and bug-free nature of the program decrease.
//  3)   This was the major problem with languages like C which relied(lag karti thi) upon functions or procedure (hence the name procedural programming language)
//  4)   As a result, the possibility of not addressing the problem adequately was high
//  5)   Also, data was almost neglected, data security was easily compromised
//  6)   Using classes solves this problem by modeling program as a real-world scenario

// Difference between Procedure Oriented Programming and Object-Oriented Programming
// Procedure Oriented Programming

//  1)   Consists of writing a set of instruction for the computer to follow
//  2)   The main focus is on functions and not on the flow of data
//  3)   Functions can either use local or global data
//  4)   Data moves openly from function to function

// Object-Oriented Programming

//  1)   Works on the concept of classes and object
//  2)   A class is a template to create objects
//  3)   Treats data as a critical element
//  4)   Decomposes the problem in objects and builds data and functions around the objects

// Basic Concepts in Object-Oriented Programming

//  1)   Classes - Basic template for creating objects
//  2)   Objects – Basic run-time entities
//  3)   Data Abstraction & Encapsulation – Wrapping data and functions into a single unit
//  4)   Inheritance – Properties of one class can be inherited into others
//  5)   Polymorphism – Ability to take more than one forms
//  6)   Dynamic Binding – Code which will execute is not known until the program runs
//  7)   Message Passing – message (Information) call format

// Benefits of Object-Oriented Programming

//  1)   Better code reusability using objects and inheritance
//  2)   Principle of data hiding helps build secure systems
//  3)   Multiple Objects can co-exist without any interference
//  4)   Software complexity can be easily managed
